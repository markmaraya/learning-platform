            What is Bootstrap?

            AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps.It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you
            extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency
            injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it
            an ideal partner with any server technology.

            Angular is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for applications.

            At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class)
            that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners),
            or even to transform the DOM element and its children.

            Angular comes with a set of these directives built-in, like ngBind, ngModel, and ngClass.

            AngularJS directives are extended HTML attributes with the prefix ng-.

            Example:

            The ng-app directive initializes an AngularJS application.

            The ng-init directive initializes application data.

            The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
