Filters

Filters format the value of an expression for display to the user. They can be used in view templates, controllers or services.
Angular comes with a collection of built-in filters, but it is easy to define your own as well.

Adding Filters to Expressions
Filters can be added to expressions by using the pipe character |, followed by a filter.

The uppercase filter format strings to upper case:

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="personCtrl">

<p>The name is {{ lastName | uppercase }}</p>

</div>

Adding Filters to Directives
Filters are added to directives, like ng-repeat, by using the pipe character |, followed by a filter:

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="namesCtrl">

<ul>
  <li ng-repeat="x in names | orderBy:'country'">
    {{ x.name + ', ' + x.country }}
  </li>
</ul>

</div>
