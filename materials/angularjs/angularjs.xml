        What is AngularJS?

        AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps.It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you
        extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency
        injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it
        an ideal partner with any server technology.

        Angular is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for applications.
