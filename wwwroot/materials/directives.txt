Directives

At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class)
that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners),
or even to transform the DOM element and its children.

Angular comes with a set of these directives built-in, like ngBind, ngModel, and ngClass.

AngularJS directives are extended HTML attributes with the prefix ng-.

Example:

The ng-app directive initializes an AngularJS application.

The ng-init directive initializes application data.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

<div ng-app="" ng-init="firstName='John'">

<p>Name: <input type="text" ng-model="firstName"></p>
<p>You wrote: {{ firstName }}</p>

</div>
